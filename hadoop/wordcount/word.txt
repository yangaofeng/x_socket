If  the  rfd  file  descriptor  has  been  added to the epoll interface using the EPOLLET (edge-triggered) flag, the call to epoll_wait(2) done in step 5 will probably hang despite the available data still
present in the file input buffer; meanwhile the remote peer might be expecting a response based on the data it already sent.  The reason for this is that  edge-triggered  mode  only  delivers  events  when
changes  occur on the monitored file descriptor.  So, in step 5 the caller might end up waiting for some data that is already present inside the input buffer.  In the above example, an event on rfd will be
generated because of the write done in 2 and the event is consumed in 3.  Since the read operation done in 4 does not consume the whole buffer data, the call to epoll_wait(2) done in  step  5  might  block
indefinitely.
